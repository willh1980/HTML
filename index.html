        <h2>Why</h2>
        <p>
          <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, is the official
          language of the World Wide Web and was first widely introduced in
          1990. HTML was originally created to allow those who were not
          specialized in SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) to publish
          and exchange scientific and other technical documents. HTML especially
          facilitated this exchange by incorporating the ability to link
          documents electronically using <em>hyperlinks</em>. Hypertext
          documents are interconnected by hyperlinks, which are typically
          activated by a mouse click, keypress, or by touching the screen. The
          first publicly available description of HTML was a document called
          “HTML Tags”, first mentioned on the Internet by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee"
            >Tim Berners-Lee</a
          >
          in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial,
          relatively simple design of HTML.

      <!-- WHAT Section -->
      <section>
        <h2>What</h2>
        <p>
          So what is a markup language anyways? In computer text processing, a
          markup language is a system for annotating a document noticeably
          different from the text. When the document is processed for display,
          the markup language is not shown, and is only used to format the text.
          The following is an example of the classic "Hello World" program:
        </p>
        <pre>
              <code>
                &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                &lt;html&gt;
                &lt;head&gt;
                    &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;/head&gt;
                &lt;body&gt;
                    &lt;div&gt;
                    &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/body&gt;
                &lt;/html&gt;  
              </code>
          </pre>
        <p>
          The HTML above will display "Hello world!" on the webpage. The text
          "This is a title" is in the head element and therefore will not be
          shown. Using the correct markup is important in conveying the correct
          semantic meaning of your text. Is this text a link? Is that text a
          source to display an image? Is this text supposed to be a heading? Is
          that paragraph related to the article? Semantic meaning answers all of
          those questions.
